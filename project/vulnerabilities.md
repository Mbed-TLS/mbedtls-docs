# Security Vulnerability Processes

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you think you have found an Mbed TLS security vulnerability, then please send an email to the security team at <mailto:mbed-tls-security@lists.trustedfirmware.org>. For more information on the reporting and disclosure process, please see the [TrustedFirmware.org security incident handling process](https://trusted-firmware-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security_center/incident_handling_process.html). There are some caveats to that process when applied to Mbed TLS, as listed below:

- Mbed TLS currently does not have any registered ESSes and so there is no primary embargo period.
-  Mbed TLS contains strong cryptography software and to comply with export control restrictions, must only distribute software publicly. As a result, security fixes cannot be shared privately with Trusted Stakeholders, although other vulnerability information can be.
- The nature of Mbed TLS often means that security fixes reveal enough information for a skilled attacker to re-construct the originally reported exploit. This combined with the previous caveat means we often expect to have to withhold security fixes until the public disclosure date.
- Mbed TLS is subject to a lot of scrutiny by security researchers who often have their own disclosure timelines when reporting vulnerabilities. As a result, the default 90 days public embargo period may often not apply.

## Advisories

Please see [the security advisories page](../security-advisories/index.md) for a complete list of Mbed TLS security advisories.
