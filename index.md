# Mbed TLS documentation hub

Mbed TLS provides an open-source implementation of cryptographic primitives,
X.509 certificate handling and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols. It provides a
reference implementation of the [PSA Cryptography API](https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api/crypto/).
The project also supports the PSA Cryptoprocessor Driver Interface which enables
support for cryptoprocessor drivers. The small code footprint makes the project
suitable for embedded systems. It has many users, including
[TF-A](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/tf-a/),
[TF-M](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/tf-m/) and
[OP-TEE](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/op-tee/).

This documentation is undergoing continuous improvement over time to address
gaps, etc. We welcome contributions!
