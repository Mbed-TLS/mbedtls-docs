## Can I use Mbed TLS in my Open Source project?

In short: Yes, you can. However, there are a few rules. As a result, a lot of Open Source projects worldwide already use Mbed TLS.

We encourage and support the use of the Mbed TLS library in Open Source projects. You may be able to use Mbed TLS even if your project does not use the Apache 2.0 or GPL licenses.
