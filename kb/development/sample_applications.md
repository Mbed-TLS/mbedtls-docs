# Sample Applications

Mbed TLS supplies several sample applications that demonstrate common use cases of the API. **These are sample programs only and do not cover full functionality of the API, or all use cases!**

These examples are in the [*programs*](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/tree/development/programs) folder, separated into subfolders according to their theme.

## *`ssl`*

These applications demonstrate common use cases for the SSL\TLS stack APIs.  

**Note: These applications use the [Mbed TLS test root certificate](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/blob/development/include/mbedtls/certs.h) and are meant to work with one another. To test the client applications with an external server, the root certificate needs to be set correctly by calling the [`mbedtls_ssl_conf_ca_chain()`](/api/ssl_8h.html#a85c3bb6b682ba361d13de1c0a1eb69fb). Alternatively, some applications allow to optionally set the CA root certificate file through the command-line. To test the server applications with external clients, they need to replace `mbedtls_x509_crt_parse()` with [`mbedtls_x509_crt_parse_file()`](/api/group__x509__module.html#gad4da63133d3590aa311488497d4c38ec) to read the server and CA certificates, as well as replacing `mbedtls_pk_parse_key()` with [`mbedtls_pk_parse_keyfile()`](/api/pk_8h.html#a935d710e542409462d0209f2381da83e).**
