# Fuzzing of Mbed TLS

This document describes public resources about fuzzing of Mbed TLS.

## Cryptofuzz

[Cryptofuzz](https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz) is a program by Guido Vranken that performs the same cryptographic operation in many crypto libraries and compares the results.

The Cryptofuzz project does not run instances of Cryptofuzz. [OSS-Fuzz](#oss-fuzz) does.

### Cryptofuzz integration

Each cryptographic library is integrated as a module: a file `modules/NAME/module.cpp` has code to dispatch operations to the library. Mbed TLS is integrated through two modules:

* [Mbed TLS](https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz/blob/master/docs/mbedtls.md) ([`mbedTLS`](https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz/tree/master/modules/mbedtls))
* [TF-PSA-Crypto](https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz/blob/master/docs/tf-psa-crypto.md) (`TF_PSA_Crypto`) (work in progress as of March 2024)

The Mbed TLS module was originally written and is primarily maintained by Guido Vranken. The TF-PSA-Crypto module is currently being written by Arm with much help from Guido.

### Building cryptofuzz

Cryptofuzz treats OpenSSL (or one of its forks) as the reference implementation that it compares the other libraries against. To work on Mbed TLS support in Cryptofuzz, you'll need:

* A reasonably recent Clang;
* A build of a reasonably recent OpenSSL, with some non-default options (so distro builds might not work);
* A recent Mbed TLS source.

Assuming you have the Cryptofuzz source in a directory `cryptofuzz`, the OpenSSL source in `cryptofuzz/openssl` and the Mbed TLS source in `cryptofuzz/mbedtls`, you can use the following build script.

````sh
#!/bin/sh

cat >/dev/null <<'EOF'
Prerequisites:
apt-get install clang libboost-dev
apt-get install libfuzzer-$(clang --version | grep -Eo '[0-9]+' | head -n 1)-dev

Ubuntu 22.04: clang fails to compile C++ programs out of the box.
Reported bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/llvm-toolchain-14/+bug/2038340
Workaround:
```
apt-get install libstdc++-12-dev
```

Ubuntu 22.04:
```
clang++ -fsanitize=address,undefined,fuzzer-no-link -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG -O2 -g -DCRYPTOFUZZ_OPENSSL_110 -I/home/gilpes01/_/crypto/cryptofuzz/openssl/include -Wall -Wextra -std=c++17 -I include/ -I . -I fuzzing-headers/include -DFUZZING_HEADERS_NO_IMPL driver.o executor.o util.o entry.o tests.o operation.o datasource.o repository.o options.o components.o wycheproof.o crypto.o expmod.o mutator.o z3.o numbers.o mutatorpool.o ecc_diff_fuzzer_importer.o ecc_diff_fuzzer_exporter.o botan_importer.o openssl_importer.o builtin_tests_importer.o bignum_fuzzer_importer.o  -fsanitize=fuzzer third_party/cpu_features/build/libcpu_features.a  -o cryptofuzz

```
Seems to be a known bug with binutils 2.38, fixed in 2.39 (so Ubuntu 22.10+ should work):

### Running Cryptofuzz

* To run cryptofuzz for some randomized testing, just run `./cryptofuzz`.
* To run a specific set of operations, pass the `--operations` option with a comma-separated list of operation names. The operation names match class names in [`cryptofuzz/operations.h`](https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz/blob/master/include/cryptofuzz/operations.h).
* To restrict the set of algorithms, you can pass `--digests`, `--ciphers`, `--curves` (all with a comma-separated list of names). For the list of available names, see `repository_tbl.h` (generated during the build) or [`gen_repository.py`](https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz/blob/master/gen_repository.py) (search for `Add( Digest("...") )`, `Add( Cipher("...") )`, `Add( ECC_Curve("...", ...) )`).

Example:
```
./cryptofuzz --operations=SymmetricEncrypt,SymmetricDecrypt --ciphers=AES_128_ECB,AES_128_CBC
```

See also [Generic running documentation](https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz/blob/master/docs/running.md).

### Reproducing Cryptofuzz crashes

If Cryptofuzz finds a (potential) bug, it aborts and leaves a `crash-*` file. Common causes of bugs are a sanitizer-triggered abort, an assertion failure in a module or a discrepancy between a library's result and the OpenSSL result.

To run Cryptofuzz on a crash file:
```
./cryptofuzz --debug crash-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

## OSS-Fuzz

[OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) is a software project that combines fuzzing-related tools with scripts to run those fuzzers on a large set of security-critical programs, including Mbed TLS. OSS-Fuzz also runs these programs on a regular basis.

### OSS-Fuzz reports

When the OSS-Fuzz infrastructure notices a fuzzer crash, the maintainers of the offending module are notified. For fuzzers where Mbed TLS is integrated, this includes the Mbed TLS security team.

Fuzzing crash reports become public after 90 days or when the crash is noticed as fixed.

### OSS-Fuzz integration

Mbed TLS is integrated in four Cryptofuzz projects:

* [bignum-fuzzer](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/bignum-fuzzer) (obsoleted by Cryptofuzz?)
* [cryptofuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/cryptofuzz) — see [“Cryptofuzz”](#cryptofuzz)
* [ecc-diff-fuzzer](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/ecc-diff-fuzzer) (obsoleted by Cryptofuzz?)
* [mbedtls](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/mbedtls) — see [“Mbed TLS fuzz programs”](#mbed-tls-fuzz-programs)

### Mbed TLS fuzz programs

The [`program/fuzz`](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/tree/development/programs/fuzz) directory contains several programs to fuzz key parsing in the PK module, X.509 certificate/CRL/CRT parsing, and TLS/DTLS handshakes and communication.

These programs, as well as a corpuse, were contributed by Philippe Antoine (catenacyber) and are now mostly maintained by Arm.

To reproduce a crash, just run `programs/fuzz/xxx_fuzz crash-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`, preferably in a debug build to understand what's going on.
